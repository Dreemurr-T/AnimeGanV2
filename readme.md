## Pytorch version of AnimeGanV2
### Basics
- **Training**
Dataset is acquired from [Link](https://github.com/TachibanaYoshino/AnimeGAN/releases/tag/dataset-1)
The hyperparameters are tuned according to the official tensorflow implementation of [AnimeGANV2](https://github.com/TachibanaYoshino/AnimeGANv2)
Use `python train.py` to train AneimeGAN from scratch, will add resume function later
If your want to tune the hyperparameters, use `python train.py --help` for more details
- **Testing**
Still working on some problems, will be added later
